# Pet adoption management application

 The aim of this project is to develop a Pet Rescue website for Annie's Animal Adoptions, an organization dedicated to finding homes for unwanted pets, including dogs, cats, birds, horses, and rabbits. The website will provide a platform for potential pet adopters to view available pets, submit adoption applications, and for administrators to manage pet listings and adoption applications. The website will be built using HTML 5, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, with database interactions handled through MySQLi.
